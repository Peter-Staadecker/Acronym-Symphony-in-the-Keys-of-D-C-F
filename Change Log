***WARNING***
This program relied on free data from Financial Modelling Prep. Unfortunately, in late 2025, Financial Modelling Prep limited which type of data will have free 
access. As a result, the program is no longer able to run and I've withdrawn it. The remaining text below and the reame file is left in place for historical use only.



DCFv14 includes the following changes from DCFv13:
1) Inclusion of the subroutine 'delay'. This subroutine ensures a minimum wait time before the next API call to Financial Modeling Prep. Without this, frequent call may result in an HTPP error 429.
2) In calculating the minimum EPS growth required for an NPV breakeven on a share purchase, DCFv13 erroneously calculated the NPV for one year too little. Corrected to be the correct number of future years.
3) Adding "pa" to several percentage printouts/Excel column headings to clarify that the percentages are per annum.
4) Clarification. Change the Excel column heading from NPV to NPV of future EPS.

DCFv15 includes the following changes from DCFv14
1) Financial Modeling Prep changed the API url, data names and structures. Updated the DCF program to take that into account.
2) Made sure that the warning "market cap less than <x>" was printed out only in the correct Excel row, and not every row.
3) Added a sentence to the introductory assumptions stating that if the Financial Modeling Prep data names and structures change, the DCF program may not function correctly. 



For the future:
